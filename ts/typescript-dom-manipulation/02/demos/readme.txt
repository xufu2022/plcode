Hi TypeScript developer,

To start the projects of this module, please install Node.js (see https://nodejs.org).

Then navigate to a "before" or "after" project folder and run 
the following commands in a terminal:

> npm install
> npm run serve

After running these commands, you can browse to the app on https://localhost:9000

Thank you,
