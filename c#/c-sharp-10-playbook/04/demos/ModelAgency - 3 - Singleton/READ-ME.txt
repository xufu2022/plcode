Unfortunately, for licensing reasons, we cannot include the pictures of dogs
with this download.  To get the code to work as shown in the video course, you must add your own pictures to the Data folder. You'll need to give the picture files the names:

missing.jpg
dog_1_Josie.jpg
dog_2_Bouncy.jpg
dog_4_Lazy.jpg

There's a near-copy of this READ-ME.txt in the data folder.
