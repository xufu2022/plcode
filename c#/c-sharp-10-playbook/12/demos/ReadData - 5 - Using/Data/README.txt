To get the 'correct' exceptions, you need to manually deny permissions on the 'PermissionDenied' file - because you can't download it with permissions already denied! 

Right-click on it in File Explorer, select 'Properties' then 'Security' and then click to deny either yourself or 'Everyone' full control of the file.  (Or if you prefer, just denying 'read' should be sufficient)
